**Untrusted —or— the Continuing Adventures of Dr. Eval** is an exciting Meta-Javascript Adventure Game wherein you guide the dashing, steadfast Dr. Eval through a mysterious MACHINE CONTINUUM, wherein, using only his trusty computer and the TURING-COMPLETE power of Javascript, he must literally ALTER HIS REALITY in order to find his freedom! You must literally edit and re-execute the very Javascript running the game in your browser to save Dr. Eval from this dark and confusing reality!

### Overview

The game presents you with a roguelike-like playing environment and a console window  with the JavaScript code generating each level. As loaded, each level is unbeatable, and most of the JavaScript is blocked from editing. The challenge is to open a path to the next level using only the limited tools left open to you.

### Development

Run
```
make
```
to merge the JavaScript files into `scripts/build/untrusted.js` (and enables debug features).

```
make release
```
merges and minifies the JavaScript files into `scripts/build/untrusted.min.js` (and disables debug features).

To run the game locally, you need to set up a local server to serve `index.html` (this step is necessary due to Access-Control-Allow-Origin restrictions).

First install [http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server/#installing-globally) if you haven't already:

```
sudo npm install http-server
```

Then run:

```
make runlocal
```
